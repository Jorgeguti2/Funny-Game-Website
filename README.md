# Troll Website
 Beginner website created as a troll game. Used to learn basic website creation with basic user interaction.

# How to Run:
- Make sure to have node.js installed on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en)
- Open a terminal in the "Website" folder directory
- Run "npm install http-server -g"
- Run "http-server"
- Open up an internet browser and access the website at "http://localhost:8080/"
- To close the website, enter ctrl+c in the same terminal you ran "http-server"

# Note:
If you are on VSCode, you can install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey to launch the website as well.
